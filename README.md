# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a showcase of my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. Built with modern technologies, it offers a seamless and interactive experience, emphasizing both functionality and design.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This portfolio website is built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, ensuring a robust, responsive, and type-safe web experience. To enhance user engagement, I've integrated **GSAP** and **Framer Motion** for dynamic animations that bring my work to life.

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building optimized, server-rendered web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and responsive UI development.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that provides type safety, ensuring fewer bugs and more maintainable code.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations.
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React that enables the creation of complex animations and transitions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, providing a consistent user experience across all devices.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Leveraging GSAP and Framer Motion, the site includes smooth, visually appealing animations that enhance user engagement.
- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section for displaying my projects, complete with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and repositories.
- **About Me**: A section that introduces who I am, my background, and what drives me as a developer.
- **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form that allows visitors to reach out to me directly from the website.
